# spanish-words-cefr

Collect Spanish vocabulary from the curriculums of the Cervantes Institute according to CEFR level.

As of now this script only collects words from sections 8 and 9 of the curriculum,
which are 'General notions' and 'Specific notions'.

The collected data of 11141 words is not provided within the repository
as I'm not sure if I'm allowed to redistribute the contents of the website or its derivatives.

The words are not lemmatized as of now.
